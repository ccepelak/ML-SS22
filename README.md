# Using Satellite Images to Predict Poverty

Poverty is a multifaceted problem manifested by conditions such as malnutrition, homelessness, lack of access to clean water, low educational achievement, and the like (UN 2005). It continues to be one the worldâ€™s most pressing issues and it has only been exacerbated by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. It follows that poverty statistics are among the most important and most widely used data in the economic and policy research sphere. Ironically, the most vulnerable economies in need of extensive and up-to-date poverty data are also those who lack the capacity to compile them.

This project aims to contribute to the research body on bridging poverty statistics measurement gaps, through the application of machine learning techniques in satellite images and open source spatial data. The machine learning model will combine satellite imagery with wealth indicators from: Ethiopia, Mali, Nigeria, and Malawi in order to offer meaningful predictions. 

# Data Sources
1. We are using satellite images from private company, Planet, which shared images from Africa for [public use](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandeshbhat/satellite-images-to-predict-povertyafrica?resource=download&select=Mali_archive).
